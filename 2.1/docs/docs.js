This can be viewed as sort of a subroutine call.  In StageNow, a Batch setting is used internally (without explicit reference by the staging administrator) to generate bar codes and NFC tags and to implement execution of the Deployment Section read from a Deployment Server.\n\nA Batch setting can also be used explicitly by a staging administrator to leverage the functionality of one Profile from within another Profile.  This could be used to create reusable 'components' as Profiles that could then be used from other Profiles by embedding or referencing them from a Batch setting.  For example, one staging administrator may create and test a Profile, demonstrate and prove that it provides some functionality.  This Profile could then be exported as XML or saved as Binary (e.g. for programming into an NFG tag).  The Profile (as XML or Binary) could then be embedded into a Batch setting.  That Batch setting could then be used (via Re-use Saved Setting) by a staging administrator in another Profile to perform the entire functionality of the embedded Profile at the point in the created Profile where the Batch setting is placed.  The staging administrator using the Batch setting would have no visibility to the Profile that is embedded in that Batch setting but would\nnonetheless be able to exploit the functionality of that embedded Profile.\n\nA Batch setting can also refer to a file in the device file system that contains a Profile (as either XML or binary) instead of embedding the Profile into the Batch setting.  Such usage would require the 'batch file' (the file containing the Profile) to be present in the device file system before the Batch setting that references it is executed in order for the proper result to occur.  Such a 'batch file' might be transferred to the device using a File setting or through some other 'out of band' method.  The Deployment Section functionality of StageNow is implemented internally and automatically using a combination of File and Batch settings without the need for the staging administrator to explicitly create either a File setting or a Batch setting.

Before installing or uninstalling certificates, a keystore must exist. You can choose to perform this action as a separate EMDK profile or include the Certificate Manager setting multiple times in one profile.\n\n#### Keystore Password\nKeystore Password is a password required to initialize the Android Keystore.\n\n### Install Certificate\n\n#### Certificate Alias\n\n* Provide the name (alias) to uniquely identify the certificate. The old certificate with same alias name is replaced by the new certificate.\n* Dynamic - The name of the certificate is dynamically generated. This is currently not supported.\n\n##### Alias Handling Issues\nDue to current limitations of the Certificate Manager setting type (in an EAP-TLS scenario), it is not possible to \"override\" the Alias that is assigned to a Client Certificate and Private Key when they are installed into the Android KeyStore.\n\nThe only way to determine the actual Alias that is assigned to a Client Certificate and Private Key when they are installed into the Android KeyStore is to examine the Android KeyStore after installation to determine which Alias was used:\n\n1. The same Alias is ALWAYS assigned to a given Client Certificate and Private Key, no matter when, or on which device, it is installed\n\n2. Whenever a different Client Certificate is used, a different Alias is generally assigned to the Client Certificate and Private Key\n\n##### Manually Determining the Certificate Alias\nYou can use a device to capture the alias used for the certificate being installed. It is recommended that you clear the keystore before performing these steps (Settings->Security->Clear Credentials).\n\n1. Use Certificate Manager to install the certificate onto a device.\n2. Navigate to Settings->Wi-Fi->'+'' to add a network\n3. Scroll to security, tap and select 802.1x EAP\n4. Scroll to EAP method, tap and select TLS\n5. Scroll to client certificate, tap and note a drop-down box with \"(unspecified)\" and the alias of the installed certificate. The alias listed can become the value to use as the certificate when using WiFiConfig to configure a profile that uses EAP-TLS.\n\n####Certificate Type  \nType of certificate to install:\n\n* CA Certificate (*.PEM)\n* Client Certificate (*.PEM)\n* Client Certificate and Private Key (*.PFX)\n* Client Certificate and Private Key (*.P12)\n* Client Certificate and Private Key (*.PKCS12)\n\n>Note: Be sure to initialize the keystore the first time when installing certificate types with private keys (.PFX,.P12,.PKCS12)\n\n#### Certificate method\nReference certificate file - method used to install a certificate. A file must exists on the device that contains the certificate data.\n\n#### Certificate File\nSpecify the path and name of the certificate file that resides on the device.\n\n#### Private Key Password\nPassword required to decrypt the private key (*.PFX, *.P12, *.PKCS12).\n\n### Uninstall Certificate\n\n#### Certificate Alias\nProvide the name (alias) to uniquely identify the certificate. The keystore or trusted CA store is searched for a record with the same alias name. If the record is found, it removes the keystore or trusted CA store. \n\n\n## Feature Compatibility\n<iframe src=\"compare.html#mx=4.3&csp=CertMgr&os=All&embed=true\"></iframe> \n"},{"key":"csp-clock","name":" Clock","md":"# Clock\n\n## About Clock\n\n### Overview\n\nThe Clock setting type sets the date and time.

Intents are an Android mechanism to perform inter-process communications to activities or services in a generic manner.\n\nAn Intent is sent by an activity or service (the requestor) within one application package and is received by one or more activities or services (the receivers) within one or more application packages.  When sending an Intent, the requestor must specify an Action indicating the operation/function to initiate and allowing the Android system to identity a suitable receiver(s) for the Intent.\n\nThere are two key types of Intents:\n\n* An Explicit Intent is directed to a single specific activity or service. To accomplish this, the requestor explicitly specifies the component to which the Intent will be sent.  Because Explicit Intents cannot be intercepted or accessed by anyone other than the intended recipient, they are inherently more secure than Implicit Intents.  Explicit Intents always produce the same result since they are always routed to the same receiver. Sending an Explicit Intent is more complex than sending an Implicit Intent because the requestor must specify specific identity details about the intended receiver, and so it fails if this information does not exactly match an installed activity or service that can accept the request.\n\n* An Implicit Intent is sent anonymously to an unspecified activity or service that can implement the operation/function requested by the specified Action.  The Android system is responsible for identifying all activities or services that COULD handle the Intent and determining which activities or services the Intent should be sent.  An Implicit Intent can be less secure than an Explicit Intent since it can be sent to an unintended receiver and/or to multiple receivers.  Implicit Intents can be less complex to send since they require information only about the request and not about the intended receiver(s).  Sending an Implicit Intent succeeds if there is any installed activity or service that can accept the request.\n\nThere are three ways to send an Intent:\n\n* Start Activity is commonly used to send both Explicit or Implicit Intents targeted at a single activity within a single application package. \n\n* Start Service sends an Intent targeted at a single service within a single application package. Start Service can be used to send Explicit or Implicit Intents, but is most commonly for Explicit Intents.\n\n* Send Broadcast sends an Intent targeted at one or more activities or services within one or more application packages. Send Broadcast can be used to send Explicit or Implicit Intents, but is most commonly used for Implicit Intents.\n\nAs noted earlier, when sending an Intent, a requestor must specify an Action that indicates the operation/function to initiate.  The requestor may also specify other attributes as part of the Intent, which include information about the requested operation/function or about the intended receiver. The following describes only those attributes that can be specified via the Intent Manager setting type.\n\n\n### Main Functionality\n\n* Launch the main activity of an application package to present the User Interface (UI) for that activity\n* Invoke a specific function within an activity within an application (with the UI associated with that function of that activity)\n* Start a service that implements one or more functions that can be used by one or more activities or services\n* Broadcast an Intent to communicate information to one or more activities or services\n\n## Parameter Notes\n\n### Action\nSpecify the intent action to perform.\n\nThe Action parameter specifies the name of the Intent Action that identifies the operation/function requested by the requestor to be performed by the receiver(s).  Many standard Android Intent Actions can be used, and applications can create their own custom Intent Actions. Following are some of the most commonly used standard Android Intent Actions:\n\n* android.intent.action.MAIN\n\nThis Intent Action requests the receiver to launch its main entry point. The exact meaning of this Action varies based on the receiver, but for most applications, this Actions launches the main activity contained within the application package. For example, this Action can launch the activity for an application that would be launched by clicking the applicationΓÇÖs main launcher icon. This Action does not generally expect any supplied data.\n\n* android.intent.action.EDIT\n\nThis Intent Action requests the receiver to launch a suitable activity to edit the supplied data.  The exact meaning of this Action varies based on the receiver, as well as the type of data that must be supplied.\n\n* android.intent.action.VIEW\n\nThis Intent Action requests the receiver to launch a suitable activity to view the supplied data.  The exact meaning of this Action varies based on the receiver, as well as the type of data that must be supplied.\n\n### MIME Type\nProvide the content MIME Type to specify in the intent.\nThe MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) Type parameter specifies the type of data to be supplied for the Intent. This parameter is meaningful only when data is supplied and is most commonly used in conjunction with the URI parameter or the File parameter to specify the type of data referenced by the URI or contained within the File. Most applications handle only a limited set of data types and only have Intents routed to them that specify data types that they support.\n\n### URI\nSet the data URI for the explicit MIME type for the intent.\nThe URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) parameter specifies the location of data the receiver uses to implement the requested operation/function. This parameter must be used in conjunction with the MIME Type attribute in order to identify the type of the data.\n\n### File\nSet the data file for the explicit MIME type for the intent.\nThe File parameter specifies the path and name of a file containing data the receiver uses to implement the requested operation/function. This parameter must be used in conjunction with the MIME Type attribute in order to identify the type of the data.\n\n### Package Name\nThe Package Name parameter specifies the application package name of the receiver to which the Intent may be sent. Only use this parameter when sending an Explicit Intent. The Package Name and Class Name attributes must always be specified together to identify a given component within an application package. The Package Name can be extracted from the APK file for an application package or must be obtained from the developer of the application package.\n\n### Class Name\nThe Class Name attribute specifies the class name of the receiver to which the Intent may be sent. Only use this parameter when sending an Explicit Intent. The Package Name and Class Name attributes must always be specified together to identify a given component within an application package. The Class Name must be obtained from the developer of the application package.\n\n### Extra Data\nSpecify Extra Data to attach to the intent.\nExtra Data parameters specify additional information that the receiver can use to implement the operation/function. The exact set of Extra Data parameters required varies based on the receiver. The Intent Manager setting type allows specifying up to five sets of Extra Data parameters. The Intent Manager setting type does not validate that the number of sets of Extra Data parameters is suitable for any specific receiver.\n\nEach set of Extra Data specified must include all the following parameters:\n\n* Type - Specifies the type of the data value provided in the Value parameter. \nThe supported types are:\n  * The Standard Integer Type parameter indicates that the value must be a 32-bit signed two's complement integer, with a minimum value of 2147483648 (-231) and a maximum value of 2147483647 (231-1).\n  * The Short Integer Type parameter indicates that the value must be a 16-bit signed two's complement integer. It has a minimum value of -32,768 (-215) and a maximum value of 32,767 (-215-1).\n  * The Long Integer Type parameter indicates that the value must be a 32-bit signed two's complement integer, with a minimum value of 9223372036854775808 (-263) and a maximum value of 9223372036854775807 (263-1).\n  * The Single Byte Integer Type parameter indicates that the value must be an 8-bit signed two's complement integer, with a minimum value of -128 (27-1) and a maximum value of 127 (27-1).\n  * The Character Type parameter indicates that the value must be a single character.\n  * The Character Sequence Type parameter indicates that the value must be sequence of characters\n  * The Floating Point Type parameter indicates that the value must be a single-precision 32-bit IEEE 754 floating point.\n  * The Boolean Type parameter indicates that the value must be true (1) or false(0).\n  * The Double Precision Floating Point Type parameter indicates that the value must be a double-precision 64-bit IEEE 754 floating point.\n  * The String Type parameter indicates that the value must be a string of characters.\n\n\n* Name - Specifies the name that identifies the data value provided in the Value parameter. The set of names supported depends on the receiver, as does the data type of the value expected for a given name and that must be specified via the Type parameter. The Intent Manager setting type does not validate that the specified name is valid or that it is suitable by any specific receiver.\n\n* Value - Specifies the value identified by the Name parameter and must be of the data type specified via the Type parameter. The Intent Manager setting type does not validate that the value meets the constraint of the specified data type or is suitable for any specific receiver.\n\n\n## Feature Compatibility\n\n<iframe src=\"compare.html#mx=4.3&csp=Intent&embed=true\"></iframe> \n"},{"key":"csp-keymap","name":" KeyMap","md":"# KeyMap\n\n## About KeyMap\n\n### Overview\n\nThe Key Mapping Manager feature allows you to modify the behavior a given key exhibits when pressed.\n\n### Main Functionality\n\n* Default all key mappings\n* Remap a key\n\n##Parameter Notes\n\n### Default all key mappings\nBy default, all keys are mapped to a specific behavior.

SSID is used to identify the network profile to acted upon when choosing an '... an Existing Network' network action above.\n\n* SSID - the SSID name of the network\n* Security Mode \n\t* Open - Open network\n\t* Personal - PSK or WEP\n\t* Enterprise - 802.1x EAP profiles\n* WPA Mode:  WPA mode used by the network. Ex: WPA, WPA2, WPA/WPA2, WEP\n>Note: WEP is not supported with a Enterprise Security Mode. It is only supported using Personal Security Mode.\n\n* Authentication Mode: Authentication mode used by the network. Used with Enterprise Security Mode. Ex: EAP-TLS, EAP-FAST-GTC, EAP-FAST-MSCHAPV2, EAP-TTLS-PAP, EAP-TTLS-MSCHAP, EAP-TTLS-MSCHAPV2, LEAP, PEAP-MSCHAPV2, PEAP-GTC\n* DHCP: When selected DHCP is used.

The same Alias is ALWAYS assigned to a given Client Certificate and Private Key, no matter when, or on which device, it is installed.\n\n2. Whenever a different Client Certificate is used, a different Alias is generally assigned to the Client Certificate and Private Key.\n\n##### Manually Determining the Certificate Alias\nYou can use a device to capture the alias used for the certificate being installed. It is recommended that the keystore be cleared before performing these steps (Settings->Security->Clear Credentials).\n\n1. Use Certificate Manager to install the certificate onto a device.\n2. Navigate to Settings->Wi-Fi->'+'' to add a network.\n3. Scroll to security, tap and select 802.1x EAP.\n4. Scroll to EAP method, tap and select TLS.\n5. Scroll to client certificate, tap and note a drop down box with \"(unspecified)\" and the alias of the installed certificate. The alias listed can become the value to use as the certificate when using WiFiConfig to configure a profile that uses EAP-TLS.\n\n### Advanced Options\n\n>Note: The following steps must be followed in order to use the Advanced Options under the WiFi setting:\n>\n>* PMKID must be enabled in order to enable PreAuth (PreAuth =1 and PMKID =1)\n>* FT must be enabled in order to enable FTRIC (FT=1 and FTRIC =1)\n>* OKC must be disabled (OKC =0 and PMKID =1) in order to use PMKID caching\n>\n> Important Note: The default \"Fast Power Savings\" value must be used for the \"Power Save\" parameter under the Advanced Options.

"},{"key":"gettingstarted","name":"Getting Started","md":"#Getting Started\n\n## Introduction\nThis section provides information on the StageNow Android Staging Solution, including an explanation of staging, its purposes, and users. \n\n## Staging\nStaging is the process where a device administrator or operator configures a device and/or deploys firmware or software to a device to prepare it for production use. This entails configuring, deploying, and managing systems and devices.\n\nAn administrator can stage all devices within an enterprise, devices in a particular store or site, or on-site/per user.\n\n## StageNow Staging Solution\nStageNow is Zebra's next generation Android Staging Solution, supporting KitKat and Jelly Bean and built on the MX 4.3/4.4 platform. It allows simple profile creation, and easy device deployment with a simple bar code scan or tag read.\n\nThe StageNow Staging Solution includes the following components:\n\n* The StageNow Workstation Tool offers a user interface that is accessed within a staging workstation (host computer). The staging administrator uses this tool to create staging profiles that configure device components, in addition to other staging actions. The Workstation Tool includes a database and server which store and save content entered in the Tool, e.g., settings and staging profiles. \n\n    Note: The tool's built-in staging server is an FTP server to which devices download the staging content of the Deployment section, files selected for download from the remote server, and RD staging files. Because multiple applications cannot use Port #21 (usually used by FTP servers) at the same time, ensure the Workstation Tool PC does not have another FTP server running in the background, or that the other FTP server uses a different port. Also note that the staging (FTP) server runs only when the tool is running, and stops when the application closes. Therefore the tool must be running when staging the device with profiles as described above.\n\n* The StageNow Client resides on the device and provides a user interface for the staging operator to initiate staging. The operator uses a staging method, e.g., prints and scans a bar code or reads an NFC tag, to deliver staging material to the device\n\n### Devices Supported\nStageNow supports all KitKat and Jelly Bean Android devices from Zebra. KitKat devices that ship with the StageNow Client installed support all StageNow features.\n\nJelly Bean and certain KitKat devices may not include the StageNow Client but do include Rapid Deployment (RD) Client. For staging, these devices can scan StageNow-generated RD bar codes, which cause the RD Client to connect to a network and then auto-install MX 4.4 and the StageNow Client on the device. The StageNow Client can then be used to scan StageNow profile bar codes for configuration. See [Rapid Deployment (RD) Client](#stageclient?Rapid%20Deployment%20(RD)%20Client) for more information on this process.\n\nOnce devices that did not include the StageNow Client are staged using the RD Client, they still may only support partial StageNow functionality due to limitations of the device OS. See the Feature Compatibility section of the specific [Setting Type](#CSPreference) to determine if your device supports a given feature. \n\n### StageNow Users\nFollowing are the StageNow users:\n\n* The staging administrator is the main user of the StageNow Workstation Tool, and is responsible for the configuration, deployment, and management of systems and client devices. The administrator creates profiles which identify the staging to perform, collects the staging content (e.g., applications), determines the staging method used to deliver the content, and uploads this material into the Workstation Tool.\n\n* The staging operator identifies the devices to stage and uses the Workstation Tool to view and select the profile(s) that the administrator published. The operator then prints the staging materials to use to stage the devices (e.g., bar codes), and uses the StageNow Client on the devices to perform the staging. The operator can then deliver the devices to the end users.\n\n### Staging Methods\nFollowing are the staging methods available via StageNow. See [Device Staging](#stageclient) for details:\n\n* Bar Code - The operator generates bar code(s) containing profile information and scans those bar codes with the device, either printed on paper or displayed on the workstation screen, to configure that device.\n\n* NFC Tag - The operator exports profile data and programs it into an NFC tag, then reads the tag with the device's NFC tag reader by bringing the tag within a certain proximity of the device, to deploy the profile to the device.\n\n## Home Screen\nTo open the tool, select the StageNow icon from the Start menu. \n\nIf published profiles are available, the Staging Operator home screen appears.\n\n![img](images/Homescreen_operator.jpg)\n\nThe Operator home screen lists favorite, latest staged, and latest published profiles. The top-right corner of the screen shows the [IP Address](#gettingstarted?Current%20IP%20Address) currently used (if any), useful for when you need to connect to the Staging Server.\n\nThe main sections of this window include the following fields:\n\n* Favorite - Select to add the profile to the Favorite Profiles list.\n\n* Name - Administrator-provided name of profile.

If this option remains off, the RD section does not appear during profile creation. \n\n* The Legacy Mode flag is off by default.\n\n* If on, the RD section appears for all profiles.\n\n* If off, the RD section is not shown to the administrator during profile creation.\n\n* If off, the RD section is grayed out for existing profiles, with a link to enable Legacy Mode. Select the link to open the Settings screen shown above and turn on the Legacy Mode flag to enable RD section content.\n\n* If off, the RD section does not appear if the administrator selected No for this section during profile creation.\n\n#### First Error Termination\nTurn this setting on to terminate the staging process upon first error. If left off, the staging process continues until the StageNow Client processes the last step in the profile. \n\n* If the First Error Termination flag is turned on, the staging process terminates on first error.\n\n* If off, the staging process proceeds until the StageNow client processes the last step in the profile.\n\n* For Xpert Mode, if First Error Termination is on, it only works if the ConditionMgr DSD is present in the profile.\n\n\n### Help\nThis launches the StageNow user guide in the default browser. \n\n### About\nThis lists the StageNow version and briefly describes the Workstation Tool. \n\n![img](images/About.jpg)\n\n## StageNow Encryption\nThe StageNow database is always encrypted and linked to the Administrator password.\n\nEncrypting staging data for use outside of the StageNow Workstation Tool protects sensitive information.\n\n* When exporting a profile, sensitive parameters are encrypted to protect confidential deployment information.\n\n* Staging bar codes and NFC tags contain configuration data and are encrypted by default to protect against reading by unauthorized devices. Note that encryption can add a significant amount of information and require additional bar codes. Use extreme caution when turning off encryption in order to speed deployment, as sensitive parameters may be vulnerable to unauthorized access.\n\n## Use Cases\nThe staging administrator uses pre-defined Wizards within the StageNow Workstation Tool to configure settings and create profiles which define software configuration and/or installation for mobile devices within an enterprise.  These Wizards represent common use cases for deploying information to devices. \n\n### StageNow Staging Process Overview\nThe general staging process is as follows. See the appropriate sections of this guide for more detail on each step.\n\n1. The administrator determines the software configuration and/or installation required for mobile devices within the enterprise.\n\n2. The administrator opens the StageNow Workstation Tool and selects one of the provided Wizards. A Wizard offers a series of screens in which the administrator defines the required configuration values to create a profile for the device(s).\n\n3. The administrator progresses through the Wizard. Certain sections of each Wizard present setting templates. Selecting and saving values on this template creates a setting, which the administrator can save for later use when creating other profiles.\n\n4. Upon completing the Wizard, the administrator creates a profile, or a series of settings.\n\n5. The administrator reviews the profile for accuracy.\n\n6. The administrator selects the method(s) for deployment, e.g., the type of bar code and/or an NFC tag.\n\n7. The administrator verifies the functionality of the profile by generating and testing the staging material.\n\n8. The administrator publishes the profile for device deployment.\n\n9. The operator uses the Workstation Tool to select the profile published by the administrator required for device deployment.\n\n10. The operator prints the staging bar code(s) or generates the NFC tag provided for the profile.\n\n11. The operator uses the StageNow Client on the device to scan the bar code or read the NFC tag, deploying the profile information to that device.\n\n### StageNow Wizards\nStageNow offers the following Wizards for creating profiles to configure mobile devices within the enterprise:\n\n* [Configure a Device](#Profiles-configdevice) - Configure the most common device settings such as locale, security options, applications, MDM enrollment, and production network settings.

If StageNow can not scan bar codes after restoring DataWedge, exit and re-launch the StageNow Client on the device.\n\n\n![img](images/Client_SNicon.jpg)\n\n\nThe application opens with the Barcode Staging screen. To select another option, open the StageNow menu.\n\n![img](images/Client_StageBarcode_Menu.jpg)\n\n\nThe StageNow Client offers the following options in the menu:\n\n* Barcode Staging - stage devices by scanning Staging bar code(s) containing profile data.\n\n* NFC Staging - stage devices by reading an NFC tag containing profile data.\n\n* Log Settings - provides log information for troubleshooting purposes.\n\n* View Client Info - provides client device version information.\n\n### Bar Code Staging\nTo deploy the selected profile to the device via staging bar codes:\n\n1. On the device, open the StageNow Client.\n\n    ![img](images/Client_StageBarcode1.jpg)\n\n\n2. Scan the bar code(s) printed from the StageNow Workstation Tool.\n\n    ![img](images/Client_StageBarcode2.jpg)\n\n\n3. The screen indicates the number of bar codes left to scan. Continue scanning all staging bar codes.\n\nUpon successful deployment, the device displays the following screen.\n\n![img](images/Client_StageBarcode_Success.jpg)\n\nIf errors occur during deployment, see Logs for troubleshooting.\n\n![img](images/stagingfailed.png)\n\n\n### NFC Staging\nTo deploy the selected profile to the device:\n\n1.

Refer to the NFC documentation for the appropriate method. The client device returns to the previous application while it processes the tag.\n\nUpon successful deployment, the device displays the success screen.\n\nIf errors occur during deployment, see Logs for troubleshooting.\n\n### Staging Wait Conditions\nThe following pop-up screens can appear during staging, indicating the device is performing an operation and that staging will complete when it is done.\n\nInitializing\n\nUpon a device reboot, MX Framework requires up to 2 minutes to initialize in order to prepare for staging. If staging is initiated during this time, the StageNow Client indicates this via the following pop-up.\n\n![img](images/initializing_popup.png)\n\n\nAcquiring IP\n\nThe following pop-up appears when the device is acquiring an IP address. This is typically seen during scan-and-dock, when the operator scans a bar code and places the device in an Ethernet cradle. Staging pauses until the device acquires the IP address while it performs network operations, such as downloading a file from the StageNow staging server.\n\n![img](images/acquiring_ip_popup.png)\n\n\nDownloading\n\nThe following pop-up indicates that the client is processing a staging profile that contains a setting to download some content from the staging server (particularly an OS update package).\n\n![img](images/file_download.png)\n\n\n## Logs\nIf the staging fails, a screen appears indicating this.\n\n![img](images/Client_staging_failed2.jpg)\n\nTo review the log to determine the cause of the error, select Yes, or from the StageNow Client menu, select Log Settings and select View Log.\n\n![img](images/Client_StageBarcode_LogSettings_View.jpg)\n\nLocate the error(s) in the log. Refer to the characteristic-error or parm-error in the log contents.\n\n## Client Information\nThe Client Info screen lists software version information for the device. To view this screen, from the StageNow Client menu, select View Client Info.\n\n![img](images/viewclientinfo.png)\n\nUse this screen to determine whether your device has full or partial StageNow feature functionality.\n\n* Full Functionality - the OSx Version is the same as the MXMF Version.\n\n* Partial Functionality - the OSx Version is less than the MXMF Version. See the Feature Compatibility section of the specific [Setting Types](#CSPreference) to determine if your device supports that feature.\n\n* No Functionality - no OSx Version.\n\n## Rapid Deployment Client\nJelly Bean devices and certain KitKat devices include Rapid Deployment (RD) Client rather than StageNow Client. For staging, these devices scan StageNow-generated bar codes using the RD Client. This connects the client to a network, installs MX and StageNow on the device, and launches StageNow to stage/configure the device using the settings specified in the StageNow Workstation Tool. Due to the older OS, these devices only support partial StageNow functionality.\n\nSpecifically, to stage a device that includes RD Client:\n\n1. The administrator uses the StageNow Workstation Tool to generate RD or StageNow profile bar code(s).\n\n2. The operator uses the device to scan the bar code(s). This downloads and installs other device components, including MX Framework and the StageNow Client.\n\n3. The device reboots, and then StageNow Client automatically launches and completes the staging process in order to apply the profile settings. \n\n![img](images/Client_RDclient.png)\n"},{"key":"stagingprofiles","name":"Profiles","md":"#Profiles\n\n## Introduction\nThis section provides information for the staging administrator on creating and managing profiles.

Select the checkbox offered in order to dismiss the tip permanently. Select OK to dismiss the pop-up.\n\n![img](images/Review_withHelppopup.jpg)\n\n\n## Creating a Staging Profile\nThe staging administrator uses the provided StageNow Wizards to configure settings which define software configuration and installation for enterprise devices. When creating a profile for staging the device, the administrator progresses through the following steps in the banner provided in the Workstation Tool:\n\n![img](images/banner.jpg)\n\n* [Config](#stagingprofiles?Configure) (StageNow and RD) - The setting information entered in the StageNow Config section is stored within StageNow bar codes and NFC tags.  The setting information entered in the RD Config section is stored within RD bar codes.  Note that the RD Config section only appears if you turned on Legacy Mode in the [Settings](#gettingstarted?Settings) screen. The amount of settings created in this section affect the number of bar codes and/or NFC tags that the system generates later.\n\n* [Deployment](#stagingprofiles?Deployment) - This information includes settings that do not reside in StageNow bar codes or NFC tags, and is represented as a file on the StageNow deployment server and so requires network connection. Reading the bar code or NFC tag created in the Config section connects the client device to the server and points to this file for deployment. Note that this section does NOT appear in the Connect Network, Manage Device Security, and Wipe a Device Wizards.\n\n* [Review](#stagingprofiles?Review) - The Review section presents all setting information entered in the Config and Deployment sections in a single page. The administrator can add comments, complete the profile, or return to any setting to update it.\n\n* [Publish](#stagingprofiles?Publish) - The Publish section allows the administrator to select the method of delivery (linear bar codes, PDF417 bar codes, and/or NFC tags) for the completed profile, as well as test, publish, and stage the profile.\n\n### Profile States\nAs you progress through the Wizard, the top right corner of the window reflects the state of the profile: \n\n![img](images/profilestatus.jpg)\n\n* Incomplete - The profile is not yet complete.\n\n* Complete - All information required by the Wizard is included in the profile, but it is not yet tested to ensure the profile functions as intended.\n\n* Tested - The profile was tested to determine whether it is sufficiently operational for staging. It is not yet visible to the operator.\n\n* Published - The profile is visible to the operator.\n\n* Staged - The operator has acquired the profile, i.e., generated bar codes or exported data to write to an NFC tag for staging the device.\n\n### Navigating the Wizard\nFollowing are tips for navigating through the Wizard.\n\nClick on the sections of the primary banner (e.g., StageNow Config, RD Config) to view that section. Note that you must complete each section in order before you can click ahead to the next section.\n\n![img](images/banner.jpg)\n\n\nYou can also use the Back button to return to the previous section and the Continue button to proceed to the next section.\n\n![img](images/backcontinue.jpg)\n\n\nSimilarly, click on the oval buttons in the secondary banner to view that sub-section. You must also complete each sub-section before clicking ahead to the next one. \n\n![img](images/bubbles.jpg)\n\nThe small round buttons adjacent to each oval button indicate the status of that section:\n\n  *  A green check icon indicates that section is complete.\n\n  *  A green eye icon indicates the section you are viewing.\n\n  *  An orange icon with a pencil indicates the section that is in process.\n\n  *  An orange icon with a pause indicates the section that is in process while you are viewing another section.\n\n  *  A greyed-out oval with no adjacent round button indicates a section not yet started.\n\nYou can also use the arrows at the beginning and end of the secondary banner to scroll through these sub-sections. \n\n![img](images/arrow.jpg)\n\n\nWhen you select Yes for a secondary banner item, additional sub-sections are added to the banner. \n\n![img](images/subsection.jpg)\n\nTo edit the profile name, click the pencil icon next to the name.\n\n![img](images/RenameProfile.jpg)\n\nAt any point, click the Home button to return to the Home screen. \n\n![img](images/homebutton.jpg)\n\n\nWhen populating a setting template window within a Wizard, to make the setting available for selection when creating other profiles, select the Save Setting for Re-use checkbox, and enter a name for the setting. See [Save for Reuse](#settingconfig?Save%20for%20Reuse) for more information.\n\n### Configure\nTo create a profile, open the StageNow Workstation Tool and log in.\n\nSelect Create New Profile, and then select the device MX version from the drop-down menu. The tool retains the current selection when configuring future profiles.\n\nInitially, a warning appears indicating that selecting an incorrect version can cause staging to fail. If your devices run multiple versions of MX, select the lowest common version. Select the checkbox on this window if you do not need to view it in future profile creations.\n\n![img](images/WizardList_MXdropdown.jpg)\n\nSelect one of the following Wizards and select Create.\n\n* [Configure a Device](#Profiles-configdevice)\n\n* [Connect Network](#Profiles-ConnectNetwork)\n\n* [Enroll in an MDM](#Profiles-enrollmdm)\n\n* [Manage Applications](#Profiles-manageapps)\n\n* [Manage Device Security](#Profiles-managesecurity)\n\n* [Perform OS Update](#Profiles-osupdate)\n\n* [Wipe a Device](#Profiles-wipedevice)\n\n* [Xpert Mode](#Profiles-xpertmode)\n\nAfter completing the StageNow Config and RD Config sections of the Wizard, proceed to the next section of the Wizard.  Certain Wizards include a Deployment section, whereas others proceed to the Review section.\n\n### Deployment\nUse the Deployment section of the Wizard to specify the subset of the settings that define what the profile does, and store these settings on a deployment server. See the specific [Profile Wizard](#ProfileWizards) for instructions. \nNote that this section is not available in certain Wizards. \n\nWizards that include the Deployment section require that device(s) access the Deployment Server in order to acquire the information provided there. Specifically, the device and the server should be on the same network, or there should be routing from the device network that allows connection to the Deployment Server. \n\n![img](images/createprofile_deploy1.jpg)\n\n### Review\nThe Review section of the Wizard allows you to verify your selections.\n\n![img](images/OSUpdate_Review.jpg)\n\n1. Select Expand to view the StageNow configuration and RD configuration settings. This setting list offers the following fields:\n    * Step - The section step where the Administrator added the setting.\n    * Last Updated - Last time the profile was updated\n    * View - Click to view/modify the setting.\n\n\n\n2. Select Change to make any changes to the settings.\n\n3. Select the icon next to Profile Description to enter a description for the profile.\n\n    ![img](images/profiledescription.jpg)\n\n\n4. Enter the description and select Save.\n\n5. Encryption for staging data is selected by default in order to protect the sensitive data encoded in the profile bar code or NFC tag. See [StageNow Encryption](#gettingstarted?StageNow%20Encryption)  for more information. De-select this checkbox if necessary to save space.\n\n6. Select Complete Profile to proceed to the Publish window. The profile status at the top right of the screen is now Complete.\n\n### Publish\nThe Publish section of the Wizard allows you to select a staging method, test the method for profile functionality, and make the profile available to the staging operator.\n\n![img](images/ConnectNetwork_Publish.jpg)\n\nThis window lists the profile delivery types available, with dates and times of when the profile was Last Tested, Published, and Last Staged.\n\nTo publish a profile:\n\n1. Select the appropriate checkboxes for the desired bar code types, or select an NFC tag, for deployment.\n\n2. Select Test to test the functionality of the profile before publishing. This generates a PDF of test staging bar code(s). While this step is optional, it is important to determine whether the profile functions as intended before making it available to the operator(s) for staging devices.\n\n    ![img](images/SNBarCode_Test.jpg)\n\n3. If the staging material functions properly, select Publish to publish the material for operator use. Note that the administrator can choose to publish only certain types of bar codes and/or NFC tags that were successfully tested, and publish the others when they are ready.\n\n4. Enter staging instructions for the operator, and select Publish Now.\n\n    ![img](images/ConnectNetwork_Publish_Instructions.jpg)\n\n\n    ![img](images/ConnectNetwork_Publish_Staged.jpg)\n\nTo unpublish a profile to remove operator access, select Unpublish.\n\n## Copying a Staging Profile\n\nTo copy a profile in order to create a new, similar profile:\n\n1. Select the Copy icon next to the profile. ![img](images/icon_copy.jpg)\n\n2. Enter a new name for the profile, and select Save. \n\n    ![img](images/profile_copy_name.jpg)\n\n3.

This entails configuring, deploying, and managing systems and devices.\n\nStaging can be performed at a centralized location, where all devices in an enterprise are configured and deployed together, in a particular store or site, where all devices at that site are configured and deployed, or on-site/per user, where a single device is configured for that site or user.\n\n## Stage Now Staging Solution\nStageNow is ZebraΓÇÖs next generation Android staging solution, supporting KitKat and Jelly Bean and built on the MX 4.3 platform. It allows simple profile creation, and easy device deployment with a simple bar code scan or tag read.\n\nThe StageNow solution includes the following components:\n* The Staging Tool offers a user interface that is accessed within a staging workstation (host computer). The staging administrator uses this tool to create staging profiles by configuring device components, in addition to other staging actions.\nThe Staging Tool includes the Staging Database and Staging Server which store content entered in the Staging Tool, e.g., setting templates and staging profiles. Staging data is persistent.\n* The Staging Client resides on the device and provides a user interface for the staging operator to initiate staging. The operator uses a staging modality, e.g., prints and scans a bar code, to deliver staging material to the device\n\n### Devices Supported\nStageNow supports All KitKat and Jelly Bean Android Devices:\n\n* TC70 (Android KitKat 4.4.2)\n\n* TC55 (non GMS) (Android Jelly Bean 4.1.2) \n\n* MC40 (Android Jelly Bean 4.1.1)\n\n### StageNow Users\nFollowing are the StageNow users:\n* The staging administrator is the main user of the Staging Tool, and is responsible for the configuration, deployment, and management of systems and client devices. The administrator creates profiles which identify the staging to perform, collects the staging content (e.g., applications), and uploads this content into the Staging Tool.\n* The staging operator identifies the devices to stage and uses the Staging Tool to view and select the profiles that the administrator published. The operator then determines the staging materials to use to stage the devices (e.g., bar codes), performs the staging, and delivers the devices to the end users\n\n### Staging Methods/Modalities\nFollowing are the staging methods available via StageNow. See Device Staging on page 4-1 for details:\n* Bar Code Profile - The operator prints the bar code(s) containing profile information and scans with the device to configure that device.\n* NFC Tag - The operator exports profile data to an NFC tag, then reads the tag with the device within a certain proximity to deploy the profile to the device.\n\n"}];
