## About Battery

### Overview
Zebra's device batteries store information in internal memory, for instance the number of charge cycles a battery has accumulated. Zebra's Android devices expose this through a battery settings menu that displays the accumulated information.  These Android devices are configured with a Decommission Threshold Value that is the maximum number of charge cycles a battery can accumulate before being flagged as a battery that should be replaced. Battery Manager allows the developer to modify that Decommission Threshold from its factory setting.
