5. To choose to connect to this network using StageNow bar codes, select Yes, and then select Continue. See [Profiles / Connect Network](../Profiles/ConnectNetwork) for instructions on connecting to a network and populating the settings window. Select Continue when done.

    Note: This wizard includes a Deployment section. Deployment requires that the host computer and the device(s) are on the same network.

See [Rapid Deployment (RD) Client](../stageclient?Rapid%20Deployment%20Client) for more information.

7. If you selected Yes, choose whether to set up Wi-Fi options and/or Wi-Fi profiles. See [Setting Types / Wifi mgr](../csp/wifi).
