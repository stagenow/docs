#Xpert Mode
Xpert Mode allows enhanced control of the options and processes offered through the Profile Wizards and Setting Types in order to build custom profiles.

In this mode, the administrator can use any settings or any Wizards.  For example, an administrator can use the Configure a Device Wizard within the Expert Mode Wizard, but include additional required settings after the settings offered in the standard Wizard. In this manner, administrators who are experts can take advantage of the flexibility offered by StageNow to use features not covered in the existing Wizards. Note that this does not apply in the RD section of the Xpert Wizard, which still restricts the administrator to selecting certain settings rather than allowing any RD setting.

Note that all settings created within the configuration sections of the StageNow tool are stored in the staging bar code(s) or NFC tag, while settings created in the deployment section reside on the deployment server.

To create an Xpert Mode profile:

1. Select Create New Profile.

2. Select the MX version from the drop-down menu.

3. Select the Xpert Mode Wizard, and select Create.

    Note: During profile creation, the top right of the window indicates the status of the profile, e.g., Incomplete.

5. On the Add/Edit window, select the SETTINGS tab in order to modify an existing setting to apply to the Xpert Mode profile, or the WIZARD tab to modify a Profile Wizard to use in the Xpert Mode profile.

6. Select the CONFIG or DEPLOY tab to select the portions of the Profile Wizard to include in the Xpert Mode profile.

7. Select Create (or Update if you are updating an existing Xpert Mode profile).
