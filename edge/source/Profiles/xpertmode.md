#Xpert Mode
Xpert Mode allows enhanced control of the options and processes offered through the Profile Wizards and Setting Types in order to build custom profiles.

In this mode, the administrator can use any settings and/or any Wizards offered in the StageNow tool, in any order.  For example, an administrator can use the Configure a Device Wizard within the Expert Mode Wizard, but include additional settings as well as those offered in the standard Wizard. In this manner, administrators who are experts can take advantage of the flexibility offered by StageNow to use features not covered in the existing Wizards. Note that this does not apply in the RD section of the Xpert Wizard, which still restricts the administrator to selecting certain settings.

>Note:  
>All settings created within the configuration sections of the StageNow tool are stored in the staging bar code(s), audio file, or NFC tag, while settings created in the deployment section reside on the deployment server.

To create an Xpert Mode profile:

1. Select Create New Profile.

2. Select the MX version from the drop-down menu.

3. Select the Xpert Mode Wizard, and select Create.
