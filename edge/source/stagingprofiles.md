#Profiles

## Introduction
This section provides information for the staging administrator on creating and managing profiles. The StageNow Workstation Tool offers pre-defined Wizards that represent common use cases for deploying information to mobile devices within the enterprise. 

### Welcome Tips
Several screens throughout the Workstation Tool offer helpful pop-up tips. Select the checkbox offered in order to dismiss the tip permanently. Select OK to dismiss the pop-up.

## Creating a Staging Profile
The staging administrator uses the provided StageNow Wizards to configure settings which define software configuration and installation for enterprise devices. When creating a profile for staging the device, the administrator progresses through the following steps in the banner provided in the Workstation Tool:

![img](images/banner.jpg)

* [Config](../stagingprofiles?Configure) (StageNow and RD) - The setting information entered in the StageNow Config section is stored within StageNow bar codes, NFC tags, and/or an audio file.  The setting information entered in the RD Config section is stored within RD bar codes.  Note that the RD Config section only appears if you turned on Legacy Mode in the [Settings](../gettingstarted?Settings) screen. The amount of settings created in this section affect the number of bar codes and/or NFC tags that the system generates later.

* [Deployment](../stagingprofiles?Deployment) - This information includes settings that do not reside in StageNow bar codes, NFC tags, or audio file, and is represented as a file on the StageNow deployment server and so requires network connection. Reading the bar code or NFC tag, or playing an audio file created in the Config section connects the client device to the server and points to this file for deployment. Note that this section does NOT appear in the Connect Network, Manage Device Security, and Wipe a Device Wizards.

* [Review](../stagingprofiles?Review) - The Review section presents all setting information entered in the Config and Deployment sections in a single page. The administrator can add comments, complete the profile, or return to any setting to update it.

* [Publish](../stagingprofiles?Publish) - The Publish section allows the administrator to select the method of delivery (linear bar codes, PDF417 bar codes, NFC tags, or Audio file) for the completed profile, as well as test, publish, and stage the profile.

### Profile States
As you progress through the Wizard, the top right corner of the window reflects the state of the profile: 

![img](images/profilestatus.jpg)

* Incomplete - The profile is not yet complete.

* Complete - All information required by the Wizard is included in the profile, but it is not yet tested to ensure the profile functions as intended.

* Tested - The profile was tested to determine whether it is sufficiently operational for staging. It is not yet visible to the operator.

* Published - The profile is visible to the operator.

* Staged - The operator has acquired the profile, i.e., generated bar codes, exported data to write to an NFC tag, or downloaded the audio file for staging the device.

### Navigating the Wizard
Following are tips for navigating through the Wizard.

Click on the sections of the primary banner (e.g., StageNow Config, RD Config) to view that section. Note that you must complete each section in order before you can click ahead to the next section.

![img](images/banner.jpg)


You can also use the Back button to return to the previous section and the Continue button to proceed to the next section.

![img](images/backcontinue.jpg)


Similarly, click on the oval buttons in the secondary banner to view that sub-section. You must also complete each sub-section before clicking ahead to the next one. 

![img](images/bubbles.jpg)

The small round buttons adjacent to each oval button indicate the status of that section:

  *  A green check icon indicates that section is complete.

  *  A green eye icon indicates the section you are viewing.

  *  An orange icon with a pencil indicates the section that is in process.

  *  An orange icon with a pause indicates the section that is in process while you are viewing another section.

  *  A greyed-out oval with no adjacent round button indicates a section not yet started.

You can also use the arrows at the beginning and end of the secondary banner to scroll through these sub-sections. 

![img](images/arrow.jpg)


When you select Yes for a secondary banner item, additional sub-sections are added to the banner. 

![img](images/subsection.jpg)

To edit the profile name, click the pencil icon next to the name.

![img](images/RenameProfile.jpg)

At any point, click the Home button to return to the Home screen. 

![img](images/homebutton.jpg)


When populating a setting template window within a Wizard, to make the setting available for selection when creating other profiles, select the Save Setting for Re-use checkbox, and enter a name for the setting. See [Save for Reuse](../settingconfig?Save%20for%20Reuse) for more information.

## Configure
To create a profile, open the StageNow Workstation Tool and log in.

Select Create New Profile, and then select the device MX version from the drop-down menu. The tool retains the current selection when configuring future profiles.

Initially, a warning appears indicating that selecting an incorrect version can cause staging to fail. If your devices run multiple versions of MX, select the lowest common version. Select the checkbox on this window if you do not need to view it in future profile creations.

![img](images/WizardList_MXdropdown.jpg)

Select one of the following Wizards and select Create.

* [Configure a Device](../Profiles/configdevice)

* [Connect Network](../Profiles/ConnectNetwork)

* [Enroll in an MDM](../Profiles/enrollmdm)

* [Manage Applications](../Profiles/manageapps)

* [Manage Device Security](../Profiles/managesecurity)

* [Perform OS Update](../Profiles/osupdate)

* [Wipe a Device](../Profiles/wipedevice)

* [Xpert Mode](../Profiles/xpertmode)

After completing the StageNow Config and RD Config sections of the Wizard, proceed to the next section of the Wizard.  Certain Wizards include a Deployment section, whereas others proceed to the Review section.

## Deployment
Use the Deployment section of the Wizard to specify the subset of the settings that define what the profile does, and store these settings on a deployment server. See the specific [Profile Wizard](../ProfileWizards) for instructions. 
Note that this section is not available in certain Wizards. 

Wizards that include the Deployment section require that device(s) access the Deployment Server in order to acquire the information provided there. Specifically, the device and the server should be on the same network, or there should be routing from the device network that allows connection to the Deployment Server.

## Review
The Review section of the Wizard allows you to verify your selections.

6. Select Complete Profile to proceed to the Publish window. The profile status at the top right of the screen is now Complete.

## Publish
The Publish section of the Wizard allows you to select a staging method, test the method for profile functionality, and make the profile available to the staging operator.

This window lists the profile delivery types available, with dates and times of when the profile was Last Tested, Published, and Last Staged.
