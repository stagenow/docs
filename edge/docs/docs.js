When this setting is enabled, the device only allows user installed applications on the Whitelist to be executed and/or installed (some applications that are part of the default operating system are still available). To disable the Whitelist, select 'Single User Without Whitelist'.  \n\n>Note:  \n>It is important to include the executing EMDK application in the Whitelist, otherwise your application loses control of the Whitelist configuration and you can not change the behavior.\n\n### Main Functionality\n\n* Set Device Operation Mode to Single User without Whitelist\n* Set Device Operation Mode to Single User with Whitelist\n* Set System Settings Access to Full Access \n* Set System Settings Access to Reduced Access \n* Set Application Verification Mode to do not Verify App Signature\n* Set Application Verification Mode to Verify User App Signature\n* Set Application Verification Mode to Verify All App Signature\n* Delete Specified Packages \n* Delete All Packages \n* Delete Specified Signatures\n* Add Specified Package\n* Add Package to to List of Applications Allowed to Submit XML\n* Remove Package from List of Applications Allowed to Submit XML\n* Allow all Applications that can be Executed to Submit XML\n\n##Parameter Notes\n### Operation Mode\n* Single User Without Whitelist - Disables all Whitelist features.\n* Single User With Whitelist - Enables the Whitelist feature based on the details provided. You can choose to add or delete packages from the current Whitelist\n\n###System Settings Access\n>Note: This setting is available when the operation mode is `Single User With Whitelist`\n\n* Full Access - The device's System Settings Menu are not reduced\n* Reduced Access - The device's System Settings menu are reduced to a pre-selected group of options (Display, Volume, About)\n\n### Application Verification\nApplication Verification adds another level of security to Whitelist applications beyond verifying a package name. If you provide a signature for the package, the Whitelist only allows that exact package signature to launch.\n\n### Delete Packages\nOptions for deleting packages from the Whitelist\n\n* Delete No Packages - Does not delete any packages\n* Delete All Packages - Deletes all packages \n* Delete Specified Package - Delete specified package\n\t* Delete Package Name: Name of package(s) separated by a comma ex: com.mycompany.mypackage \n\n### Add Packages\nOptions for adding packages to the Whitelist\n\n* Add No Packages - Does not add any packages\n* Add Specified Package - Add specified package\n\t* Add Package Name: Name of package(s) separated by a comma ex: com.mycompany.mypackage \n\n>Note: It is important to include the executing EMDK application in the Whitelist otherwise your application loses control of the Whitelist configuration and you can not change the behavior without an enterprise reset.\n\n### Allow Application To Submit XML\n>Note: This setting is supported on devices running KitKat versions of Android such as the TC70 and are only used when the Whitelist feature is enabled.\n\nYou can specify and restrict the ability for specific applications to submit changes to the MX Framework.\n\n* Allow Package Names - Provide a comma separated list of package names allowed to submit XML to the MX framework.\n* Disallow Package Names - Provide a comma separated list of package names not allowed to submit XML to the MX framework.\n\n> WARNING: Always include the EMDK for Android service package name `com.symbol.emdkservice` when this setting is enabled, otherwise Profile features (excluding DataCapture) can not be processed. \n\n\n## Feature Compatibility\n<iframe src=\"compare.html#mx=4.3&csp=AccessMgr&embed=true\"></iframe> \n"},{"key":"csp-analyticsmgr","name":" Analytics","md":"# Analytics\n\n## About Analytics\n\n### Overview\n\nThe Analytics Manager setting type configures the device data to collect, and indicates where to store the collected data.\n\n### Main Functionality\n\n* Enable/Disable Analytics - the user could 'Opt In' for data collection or 'Opt Out' of data collection.\n* Set Transport Method for the data collected.

This can be viewed as sort of a subroutine call.  In StageNow, a Batch setting is used internally (without explicit reference by the staging administrator) to generate bar codes and NFC tags and to implement execution of the Deployment Section read from a Deployment Server.\n\nA Batch setting can also be used explicitly by a staging administrator to leverage the functionality of one Profile from within another Profile.  This could be used to create reusable 'components' as Profiles that could then be used from other Profiles by embedding or referencing them from a Batch setting.  For example, one staging administrator may create and test a Profile, demonstrate and prove that it provides some functionality.  This Profile could then be exported as XML or saved as Binary (e.g. for programming into an NFG tag).  The Profile (as XML or Binary) could then be embedded into a Batch setting.  That Batch setting could then be used (via Re-use Saved Setting) by a staging administrator in another Profile to perform the entire functionality of the embedded Profile at the point in the created Profile where the Batch setting is placed.  The staging administrator using the Batch setting would have no visibility to the Profile that is embedded in that Batch setting but would\nnonetheless be able to exploit the functionality of that embedded Profile.\n\nA Batch setting can also refer to a file in the device file system that contains a Profile (as either XML or binary) instead of embedding the Profile into the Batch setting.  Such usage would require the 'batch file' (the file containing the Profile) to be present in the device file system before the Batch setting that references it is executed in order for the proper result to occur.  Such a 'batch file' might be transferred to the device using a File setting or through some other 'out of band' method.  The Deployment Section functionality of StageNow is implemented internally and automatically using a combination of File and Batch settings without the need for the staging administrator to explicitly create either a File setting or a Batch setting.  But a staging administrator COULD use such settings to construct more advanced or customized staging deployment scenarios.\n\n\n### Main Functionality\n\n* Process a file in the device file system that contains a Profile\n* Process a Profile that is embedded within the Batch setting\n* Process Profiles that are XML or binary\n* Process Profiles that are optionally encrypted\n\n## Batch File Type\n* XML - the Profile is encoded as XML\n* Binary - the Profile is encoded as binary\n\n## Access Method\nWhen choosing **Device File System**, enter a path and file name on the device where the XML or binary file to be processed will be located.\n\nWhen choosing **Embedded in XML**, select an XML or binary file in the workstation file system. This file is encoded and placed into the Batch setting.\n\n\n##Encryption methods\n* Opaque - Cannot be examined, only the StageNow Client can decrypt with a private key.\n* Immutable - Cannot be modifed, but anyone can decrypt with a public key. Future, not supported in StageNow V2.0.\n\n\n## Feature Compatibility\n\n<table class=\"table\">\n\t<tr>\n\t\t<th>Parameters</th>\n\t\t<th>MC32</th>\n\t\t<th>MC40</th>\n\t\t<th>MC67</th>\n\t\t<th>TC55</th>\n\t\t<th>TC70</th>\n\n\t</tr>\n\n\t<tr>\n\t\t<td>Execute Server XML</td>\n\t\t<td><i class=\"fa fa-check-circle\"></i>\n\t\t<td><i class=\"fa fa-check-circle\"></i>\n\t\t<td><i class=\"fa fa-check-circle\"></i>\n\t\t<td><i class=\"fa fa-check-circle\"></i>\n\t\t<td><i class=\"fa fa-check-circle\"></i>\n\t</tr>\n\t<tr>\n\t\t<td>Execute Server Binary</td>\n\t\t<td><i class=\"fa fa-check-circle\"></i>\n\t\t<td><i class=\"fa fa-check-circle\"></i>\n\t\t<td><i class=\"fa fa-check-circle\"></i>\n\t\t<td><i class=\"fa fa-check-circle\"></i>\n\t\t<td><i class=\"fa fa-check-circle\"></i>\n\t</tr>\n\t<tr>\n\t\t<td>Embedded Binary</td>\n\t\t<td><i class=\"fa fa-check-circle\"></i>\n\t\t<td><i class=\"fa fa-check-circle\"></i>\n\t\t<td><i class=\"fa fa-check-circle\"></i>\n\t\t<td><i class=\"fa fa-check-circle\"></i>\n\t\t<td><i class=\"fa fa-check-circle\"></i>\n\t</tr>\n\t<tr>\n\t\t<td>Embedded XML</td>\n\t\t<td><i class=\"fa fa-check-circle\"></i>\n\t\t<td><i class=\"fa fa-check-circle\"></i>\n\t\t<td><i class=\"fa fa-check-circle\"></i>\n\t\t<td><i class=\"fa fa-check-circle\"></i>\n\t\t<td><i class=\"fa fa-check-circle\"></i>\n\t</tr>\n</table>"},{"key":"csp-battery","name":" Battery","md":"# Battery\n\n## About Battery\n\n### Overview\nZebra's device batteries store information in internal memory, for instance the number of charge cycles a battery has accumulated.

You can use digital certificates to identify your device for a variety of purposes, including VPN or Wi-Fi network access as well as authentication to servers by apps such as Email or Chrome. \n\n### Main Functionality\n\n* Install Certificate\n* Uninstall Certificate\n* Initialize Android Keystore\n* Adjust System Clock\n\n##Parameter Notes\n### Initialize Android Keystore\nWhen you initialize the Android keystore you create a new keystore replacing any existing one.  Before installing or uninstalling certificates, a keystore must exist. You can choose to perform this action as a separate EMDK profile or include the Certificate Manager setting multiple times in one profile.\n\n#### Keystore Password\nKeystore Password is a password required to initialize the Android Keystore.\n\n### Install Certificate\n\n#### Certificate Alias\n\n* Provide the name (alias) to uniquely identify the certificate. The old certificate with same alias name is replaced by the new certificate.\n* Dynamic - The name of the certificate is dynamically generated. This is currently not supported.\n\n##### Alias Handling Issues\nDue to current limitations of the Certificate Manager setting type (in an EAP-TLS scenario), it is not possible to \"override\" the Alias that is assigned to a Client Certificate and Private Key when they are installed into the Android KeyStore.\n\nThe only way to determine the actual Alias that is assigned to a Client Certificate and Private Key when they are installed into the Android KeyStore is to examine the Android KeyStore after installation to determine which Alias was used:\n\n1. The same Alias is ALWAYS assigned to a given Client Certificate and Private Key, no matter when, or on which device, it is installed\n\n2. Whenever a different Client Certificate is used, a different Alias is generally assigned to the Client Certificate and Private Key\n\n##### Manually Determining the Certificate Alias\nYou can use a device to capture the alias used for the certificate being installed. It is recommended that you clear the keystore before performing these steps (Settings->Security->Clear Credentials).\n\n1. Use Certificate Manager to install the certificate onto a device.\n2. Navigate to Settings->Wi-Fi->'+'' to add a network\n3. Scroll to security, tap and select 802.1x EAP\n4. Scroll to EAP method, tap and select TLS\n5. Scroll to client certificate, tap and note a drop-down box with \"(unspecified)\" and the alias of the installed certificate. The alias listed can become the value to use as the certificate when using WiFiConfig to configure a profile that uses EAP-TLS.\n\n####Certificate Type  \nType of certificate to install:\n\n* CA Certificate (*.PEM)\n* Client Certificate (*.PEM)\n* Client Certificate and Private Key (*.PFX)\n* Client Certificate and Private Key (*.P12)\n* Client Certificate and Private Key (*.PKCS12)\n\n>Note: Be sure to initialize the keystore the first time when installing certificate types with private keys (.PFX,.P12,.PKCS12)\n\n#### Certificate method\nReference certificate file - method used to install a certificate. A file must exists on the device that contains the certificate data.\n\n#### Certificate File\nSpecify the path and name of the certificate file that resides on the device.\n\n#### Private Key Password\nPassword required to decrypt the private key (*.PFX, *.P12, *.PKCS12).\n\n### Uninstall Certificate\n\n#### Certificate Alias\nProvide the name (alias) to uniquely identify the certificate. The keystore or trusted CA store is searched for a record with the same alias name. If the record is found, it removes the keystore or trusted CA store. \n\n\n## Feature Compatibility\n<iframe src=\"compare.html#mx=4.3&csp=CertMgr&os=All&embed=true\"></iframe> \n"},{"key":"csp-clock","name":" Clock","md":"# Clock\n\n## About Clock\n\n### Overview\n\nThe Clock setting type sets the date and time.

When installing a key, the value is optional. The key value is a HEX string of length 64 bytes. If you do not provide a value, a random key is generated for a given key name. This feature does not function if a key of the same name already resides in the device key store. After installing a key, each EFS using the key is mounted. If multiple EFS use the same mount point, only the first is mounted.\n\n* Install Key Name - Provide a name for the key to install.\n* Install Key Value - Provide the key to install.\n* Revoke Key Name(s) - Provide the key name or names (separated by commas) to revoke. After revoking a key, all EFS using that key are unmounted.\n\n### Create/Delete EFS\nThis feature creates an Encrypted File System (EFS) on a device. Provide a name for the new EFS, a mount point for the EFS, a storage type (SDcard or Internal), the name of the key to use for encryption, and a size for the EFS in MB. The size must be between 1MB and 4096MB. Access to the EFS is denied during the creation process, which takes time.\n\n* Create EFS \n  * EFS Name - Provide a name for the EFS to create.\n  * EFS encryption Key Name - Provide the name of the encryption key to use to encyrpt the new EFS.\n  * EFS Location (internal/SDcard) - Select a location in which to create the new EFS.\n  * Mount point for EFS - Provide a mount point for the new EFS.\n  * Size of EFS in MB - Provide a size in MB (1-4095) for the new EFS.\n\nNote: EFS creation can fail in any of the following conditions:\n\n* Duplicate EFS name - EFS's with the same name can reside on different supporting file systems, but cannot reside on the same FS\n* EFS storage type is not available, e.g., no SD card is inserted and mounted\n* Not enough space on supporting file system \n* Key does not exist \n* Creating EFS on encrypted SDCard \n* Invalid parm values, e.g., EFS size too big or too small or not an integer number\n* Unmatched mount point and EFS storage type\n\n* Delete EFS \n  * Delete EFS Name - Provide the name of the EFS to delete.\n  * EFS Location - Select the location in which the EFS to delete resides.\n\n### Encrypt SD Card\n\n* Encrypt SDcard - Key to encrypt SDcard.

Intents are an Android mechanism to perform inter-process communications to activities or services in a generic manner.\n\nAn Intent is sent by an activity or service (the requestor) within one application package and is received by one or more activities or services (the receivers) within one or more application packages.  When sending an Intent, the requestor must specify an Action indicating the operation/function to initiate and allowing the Android system to identity a suitable receiver(s) for the Intent.\n\nThere are two key types of Intents:\n\n* An Explicit Intent is directed to a single specific activity or service. To accomplish this, the requestor explicitly specifies the component to which the Intent will be sent.  Because Explicit Intents cannot be intercepted or accessed by anyone other than the intended recipient, they are inherently more secure than Implicit Intents.  Explicit Intents always produce the same result since they are always routed to the same receiver. Sending an Explicit Intent is more complex than sending an Implicit Intent because the requestor must specify specific identity details about the intended receiver, and so it fails if this information does not exactly match an installed activity or service that can accept the request.\n\n* An Implicit Intent is sent anonymously to an unspecified activity or service that can implement the operation/function requested by the specified Action.  The Android system is responsible for identifying all activities or services that COULD handle the Intent and determining which activities or services the Intent should be sent.  An Implicit Intent can be less secure than an Explicit Intent since it can be sent to an unintended receiver and/or to multiple receivers.  Implicit Intents can be less complex to send since they require information only about the request and not about the intended receiver(s).  Sending an Implicit Intent succeeds if there is any installed activity or service that can accept the request.\n\nThere are three ways to send an Intent:\n\n* Start Activity is commonly used to send both Explicit or Implicit Intents targeted at a single activity within a single application package. \n\n* Start Service sends an Intent targeted at a single service within a single application package. Start Service can be used to send Explicit or Implicit Intents, but is most commonly for Explicit Intents.\n\n* Send Broadcast sends an Intent targeted at one or more activities or services within one or more application packages. Send Broadcast can be used to send Explicit or Implicit Intents, but is most commonly used for Implicit Intents.\n\nAs noted earlier, when sending an Intent, a requestor must specify an Action that indicates the operation/function to initiate.  The requestor may also specify other attributes as part of the Intent, which include information about the requested operation/function or about the intended receiver. The following describes only those attributes that can be specified via the Intent Manager setting type.\n\n\n### Main Functionality\n\n* Launch the main activity of an application package to present the User Interface (UI) for that activity\n* Invoke a specific function within an activity within an application (with the UI associated with that function of that activity)\n* Start a service that implements one or more functions that can be used by one or more activities or services\n* Broadcast an Intent to communicate information to one or more activities or services\n\n## Parameter Notes\n\n### Action\nSpecify the intent action to perform.\n\nThe Action parameter specifies the name of the Intent Action that identifies the operation/function requested by the requestor to be performed by the receiver(s).  Many standard Android Intent Actions can be used, and applications can create their own custom Intent Actions. Following are some of the most commonly used standard Android Intent Actions:\n\n* android.intent.action.MAIN\n\nThis Intent Action requests the receiver to launch its main entry point. The exact meaning of this Action varies based on the receiver, but for most applications, this Actions launches the main activity contained within the application package. For example, this Action can launch the activity for an application that would be launched by clicking the applicationΓÇÖs main launcher icon. This Action does not generally expect any supplied data.\n\n* android.intent.action.EDIT\n\nThis Intent Action requests the receiver to launch a suitable activity to edit the supplied data.  The exact meaning of this Action varies based on the receiver, as well as the type of data that must be supplied.\n\n* android.intent.action.VIEW\n\nThis Intent Action requests the receiver to launch a suitable activity to view the supplied data.  The exact meaning of this Action varies based on the receiver, as well as the type of data that must be supplied.\n\n### MIME Type\nProvide the content MIME Type to specify in the intent.\nThe MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) Type parameter specifies the type of data to be supplied for the Intent. This parameter is meaningful only when data is supplied and is most commonly used in conjunction with the URI parameter or the File parameter to specify the type of data referenced by the URI or contained within the File. Most applications handle only a limited set of data types and only have Intents routed to them that specify data types that they support.\n\n### URI\nSet the data URI for the explicit MIME type for the intent.\nThe URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) parameter specifies the location of data the receiver uses to implement the requested operation/function. This parameter must be used in conjunction with the MIME Type attribute in order to identify the type of the data.\n\n### File\nSet the data file for the explicit MIME type for the intent.\nThe File parameter specifies the path and name of a file containing data the receiver uses to implement the requested operation/function. This parameter must be used in conjunction with the MIME Type attribute in order to identify the type of the data.\n\n### Package Name\nThe Package Name parameter specifies the application package name of the receiver to which the Intent may be sent. Only use this parameter when sending an Explicit Intent. The Package Name and Class Name attributes must always be specified together to identify a given component within an application package. The Package Name can be extracted from the APK file for an application package or must be obtained from the developer of the application package.\n\n### Class Name\nThe Class Name attribute specifies the class name of the receiver to which the Intent may be sent. Only use this parameter when sending an Explicit Intent. The Package Name and Class Name attributes must always be specified together to identify a given component within an application package. The Class Name must be obtained from the developer of the application package.\n\n### Extra Data\nSpecify Extra Data to attach to the intent.\nExtra Data parameters specify additional information that the receiver can use to implement the operation/function. The exact set of Extra Data parameters required varies based on the receiver. The Intent Manager setting type allows specifying up to five sets of Extra Data parameters. The Intent Manager setting type does not validate that the number of sets of Extra Data parameters is suitable for any specific receiver.\n\nEach set of Extra Data specified must include all the following parameters:\n\n* Type - Specifies the type of the data value provided in the Value parameter. \nThe supported types are:\n  * The Standard Integer Type parameter indicates that the value must be a 32-bit signed two's complement integer, with a minimum value of 2147483648 (-231) and a maximum value of 2147483647 (231-1).\n  * The Short Integer Type parameter indicates that the value must be a 16-bit signed two's complement integer. It has a minimum value of -32,768 (-215) and a maximum value of 32,767 (-215-1).\n  * The Long Integer Type parameter indicates that the value must be a 32-bit signed two's complement integer, with a minimum value of 9223372036854775808 (-263) and a maximum value of 9223372036854775807 (263-1).\n  * The Single Byte Integer Type parameter indicates that the value must be an 8-bit signed two's complement integer, with a minimum value of -128 (27-1) and a maximum value of 127 (27-1).\n  * The Character Type parameter indicates that the value must be a single character.\n  * The Character Sequence Type parameter indicates that the value must be sequence of characters\n  * The Floating Point Type parameter indicates that the value must be a single-precision 32-bit IEEE 754 floating point.\n  * The Boolean Type parameter indicates that the value must be true (1) or false(0).\n  * The Double Precision Floating Point Type parameter indicates that the value must be a double-precision 64-bit IEEE 754 floating point.\n  * The String Type parameter indicates that the value must be a string of characters.\n\n\n* Name - Specifies the name that identifies the data value provided in the Value parameter. The set of names supported depends on the receiver, as does the data type of the value expected for a given name and that must be specified via the Type parameter. The Intent Manager setting type does not validate that the specified name is valid or that it is suitable by any specific receiver.\n\n* Value - Specifies the value identified by the Name parameter and must be of the data type specified via the Type parameter. The Intent Manager setting type does not validate that the value meets the constraint of the specified data type or is suitable for any specific receiver.\n\n\n## Feature Compatibility\n\n<iframe src=\"compare.html#mx=4.3&csp=Intent&embed=true\"></iframe> \n"},{"key":"csp-keymap","name":" KeyMap","md":"# KeyMap\n\n## About KeyMap\n\n### Overview\n\nThe Key Mapping Manager feature allows you to modify the behavior a given key exhibits when pressed.\n\n### Main Functionality\n\n* Default all key mappings\n* Remap a key\n\n##Parameter Notes\n\n### Default all key mappings\nBy default, all keys are mapped to a specific behavior. For instance, pressing the letter \"A\" sends a lowercase \"a\". If you modified the behavior of a key via the **Remap a key** function, then **Default all key mappings** resets all modified keys to their original behavior in all tables.\n\n>NOTE:  When adding a custom key map, you can **Default all key mappings** before applying your new key map to ensure that the key mappings are the only ones that exist after applying the profile.\n\n### Remap a key\nThe **Remap a key** function allows you to modify the behavior a key exhibits when pressed.\n\n### Key Tables\nA **Key Table** is a list of behaviors a key exhibits when pressed. The **Base** table is a list of behaviors a key has when a modifier key is **not** pressed.

For instance the **Blue Table** is only supported on devices that have a blue key.  While remapping a key, you can set the behavior for that key in each table supported by the device.\n\n>NOTE: If a profile contains a modified table not supported by a given device, that profile fails when submitted.\n\n**Modifiable key tables:**\n\n* Base - no modifier key was pressed\n* Blue - blue key was pressed before a key was pressed\n* Orange - orange key was pressed before a key was pressed\n* Grey - grey key was pressed before a key was pressed\n* Shift - shift key was pressed before a key was pressed\n* Control - control key was pressed before a key was pressed\n\n###Send key-code\nSelect this behavior to modify which key-code is sent when a key is pressed. Following is a list of possible key-codes. When modifying a key-code to send, you may also choose to select the state of a modifier key. For instance, if you are modifying the \"A\" key to send a \"B\" key-code, and set the **SHIFT state** to **Forced ON**, the physical Shift keys state is ignored and a capital \"B\" is sent. Enable modifier keys by clicking the **Andvanced** checkbox under send key-code.\n\n###Send trigger\nSelect this behavior to allow a key to act as a trigger.

It is recommended that you clear the keystore before performing these steps (Settings > Security > Clear Credentials).\n\n1. Use Certificate Manager to install the certificate onto a device.\n2. Navigate to Settings > Wi-Fi >+ to add a network.\n3. Scroll to security, tap and select 802.1x EAP.\n4. Scroll to EAP method, tap and select TLS.\n5. Scroll to client certificate, tap and note a drop-down box with \"(unspecified)\" and the alias of the installed certificate. The alias listed can become the value to use as the certificate when using WiFiConfig to configure a profile that uses EAP-TLS.\n\n### Advanced Options\n\n>Note: You must follow these steps in order to use the Advanced Options under the WiFi setting:\n>\n>* PMKID must be enabled in order to enable PreAuth (PreAuth =1 and PMKID =1)\n>* FT must be enabled in order to enable FTRIC (FT=1 and FTRIC =1)\n>* OKC must be disabled (OKC =0 and PMKID =1) in order to use PMKID caching\n>\n> Important Note: You must use the default Fast Power Savings value for the Power Save parameter under Advanced Options.

"},{"key":"gettingstarted","name":"Getting Started","md":"#Getting Started\n\n## Introduction\nThis section provides information on the StageNow Android Staging Solution, including an explanation of staging, its purposes, and users. \n\n## Staging\nStaging is the process where a device administrator or operator configures a device and/or deploys firmware or software to a device to prepare it for production use. This entails configuring, deploying, and managing systems and devices.\n\nAn administrator can stage all devices within an enterprise, devices in a particular store or site, or on-site/per user.\n\n## StageNow Staging Solution\nStageNow is Zebra's next generation Android Staging Solution, supporting Lollipop, KitKat, and Jelly Bean and built on the MX 4.3/4.4/5.X/6.0 platform. It allows simple profile creation, and easy device deployment with a simple bar code scan, tag read, or audio file play.\n\nThe StageNow Staging Solution includes the following components:\n\n* The StageNow Workstation Tool offers a user interface that is accessed within a staging workstation (host computer). The staging administrator uses this tool to create staging profiles that configure device components, in addition to other staging actions. The Workstation Tool includes a database and server which store and save content entered in the Tool, e.g., settings and staging profiles. \n\n    Note: The tool's built-in staging server is an FTP server to which devices download the staging content of the Deployment section, files selected for download from the remote server, and RD staging files. Because multiple applications cannot use Port #21 (usually used by FTP servers) at the same time, ensure the Workstation Tool PC does not have another FTP server running in the background, or that the other FTP server uses a different port. Also note that the staging (FTP) server runs only when the tool is running, and stops when the application closes. Therefore the tool must be running when staging the device with profiles as described above.\n\n* The StageNow Client resides on the device and provides a user interface for the staging operator to initiate staging. The operator uses a staging method, e.g., prints and scans a bar code, plays an audio file, or reads an NFC tag, to deliver staging material to the device\n\n### Devices Supported\nStageNow supports all Lollipop, KitKat, and Jelly Bean Android devices from Zebra. Lollipop and KitKat devices that ship with the StageNow Client installed support all StageNow features.\n\nJelly Bean and certain KitKat devices may not include the StageNow Client but do include Rapid Deployment (RD) Client. For staging, these devices can scan StageNow-generated RD bar codes, which cause the RD Client to connect to a network and then auto-install MX 5.0 for KitKat devices, MX 4.4 or lesser for Jelly Bean devices, and the StageNow Client on the device. The StageNow Client can then be used to scan StageNow profile bar codes for configuration. See [Rapid Deployment (RD) Client](#stageclient?Rapid%20Deployment%20(RD)%20Client) for more information on this process.\n\n>Note:  \n>To install StageNow client and MX on a Jelly Bean device, create a profile using wizards from MX 4.4 or lesser versions.\n\nOnce devices that did not include the StageNow Client are staged using the RD Client, they still may only support partial StageNow functionality due to limitations of the device OS. See the Feature Compatibility section of the specific [Setting Type](#CSPreference) to determine if your device supports a given feature. \n\n### StageNow Users\nFollowing are the StageNow users:\n\n* The staging administrator is the main user of the StageNow Workstation Tool, and is responsible for the configuration, deployment, and management of systems and client devices. The administrator creates profiles which identify the staging to perform, collects the staging content (e.g., applications), determines the staging method used to deliver the content, and uploads this material into the Workstation Tool.\n\n* The staging operator identifies the devices to stage and uses the Workstation Tool to view and select the profile(s) that the administrator published. The operator then prints the staging materials to use to stage the devices (e.g., bar codes), and uses the StageNow Client on the devices to perform the staging. The operator can then deliver the devices to the end users.\n\n### Staging Methods\nFollowing are the staging methods available via StageNow. See [Device Staging](#stageclient) for details:\n\n* Bar Code - The operator generates bar code(s) containing profile information and scans those bar codes with the device, either printed on paper or displayed on the workstation screen, to configure that device.\n\n* NFC Tag - The operator exports profile data and programs it into an NFC tag, then reads the tag with the device's NFC tag reader by bringing the tag within a certain proximity of the device, to deploy the profile to the device.\n\n* Audio File - The operator downloads an audio file containing profile data to the device, and plays the audio file to configure that device.\n\n## Home Screen\nTo open the tool, select the StageNow icon from the Start menu. \n\nIf published profiles are available, the Staging Operator home screen appears.\n\n![img](images/Homescreen_operator.jpg)\n\nThe Operator home screen lists the latest profiles available. The top of the screen shows the [IP Address](#gettingstarted?Current%20IP%20Address) currently used (if any), useful for when you need to connect to the Staging Server. The top of the screen also includes a [Wi-Fi Hotspot](#gettingstarted?Wi-Fi%20Hotspot) option, which allows the desktop computer to act as WiFi hotspot for staging devices.\n\nThe main sections of this window include the following fields:\n\n* Favorite - Select to add the profile to the Favorite Profiles list.\n\n* Name - Administrator-provided name of profile. Profiles requiring the client device to be connected to the staging server appear with a [Server Icon](#gettingstarted?Server%20Icon) appended to the profile name.\n\n* Administrator Comments - Any notes regarding the profile.\n\n* Last Updated - The last time an administrator updated the profile.\n\n* Latest Published - The last time the profile was published.\n\n* MX Version - The version of MX used when creating the profile.\n\n* Connection Type - How StageNow connects to a network (MX 6.0 only).\n\n* RD - Indicates whether the profile is RD enabled, i.e., whether RD bar codes can be printed from this profile.\n\nIf there are no published profiles for the Staging Operator, the Welcome screen appears.\n\n![img](images/StageNow_login.jpg)\n\n\nEnter the Administrator password set up during installation, and select Login to open the Administrator home screen.\n\n![img](images/Homescreen_admin1.jpg) \n\n\nThe Administrator home screen lists profiles grouped by stages of completion. \n\n### Current IP Address\nThe top of the screen shows the IP address currently used, useful for when you need to connect to the Staging Server.\n\nIf only one IP address is available, StageNow selects this.\n\nIf the StageNow system does not have an IP address, the Current IP section of the window displays Not Available. This can restrict printing StageNow bar codes or NFC tags.\n\nIf more than one IP address is available and neither is selected, the Current IP section of the window displays Not Selected. Click on this section to select the IP address to use for staging.\n\n![img](images/AvailableIPAddresses.jpg)\n\nSelect the IP, then select Set as Current. This IP address is retained in future operations, including after re-launch and system reboot. \n\n### Wi-Fi Hotspot\nThe StageNow tool allows the desktop computer to act as WiFi hotspot for staging devices. This allows staging without requiring an external Wi-Fi network and with a single staging bar code, and eliminates the need for reprinting bar codes if there is a profile change.\n\nIf the Wi-Fi hotspot is off, you can turn it on via the button on the heading bar.\n\n![img](images/wifi_titlebar.jpg)\n\nYou can also choose to turn the hotspot on when you start the StageNow tool via the Settings menu. \n\n\n### Change Password\nThe top right corner of the screen offers an option to change the Administrator password.\n\nSelect Change Password to change the administrator password.\n\n![img](images/ChangePassword.jpg)\n\nEnter the current password, and then enter the new password in the New Password and Confirm New Password fields.\n\nSelect Change. A window indicates that the password was changed successfully.\n\n![img](images/ChangePassword_success.jpg)\n\nSelect OK.\n\n### Software Update\nIf a new StageNow version or updated components are available and the StageNow tools is connected to a network, a message appears below the menu bar indicating this.\n\n![img](images/Update_Available.jpg)\n\nTo enable or disable this message, see [Settings](#gettingstarted?Settings) . \n\n>Note:  \n>Only an Administrator can update to the latest software and components. The administrator can also log out, and then log into the StageNow tool again to check for the latest software or component updates.\n\nSelect Learn More for more information on what is new in the latest available version, or what component(s) are available. \n\n![img](images/Update_LearnMore.jpg)\n\nSelect Try Later or X to dismiss this window and the auto-update tool bar.\n\n\n#### StageNow Tool Update\n\n![img](images/Update_Available.jpg)\n\n1.

If left off, the staging process continues until the StageNow Client processes the last step in the profile. \n\n* If the First Error Termination flag is turned on, the staging process terminates on first error.\n\n* If off, the staging process proceeds until the StageNow client processes the last step in the profile.\n\n* For Xpert Mode, if First Error Termination is on, it only works if the ConditionMgr DSD is present in the profile.\n\n#### Check for software updates on startup\nTurn this setting on to display a message below the menu bar indicating when there is a new StageNow version available. \n\n#### Always turn WiFi Hotspot on at startup\nThe StageNow tool allows the desktop computer to act as WiFi hotspot for staging devices.\n\nTurn this setting on to turn the Wi-Fi hotspot on when you start the StageNow tool. \n\nIf the Wi-Fi hotspot is off, you can also turn it on via the button on the heading bar.\n\n![img](images/wifi_titlebar.jpg)\n\n### Help\nThis launches the StageNow user guide in the default browser. \n\n### About\nThis lists the StageNow version and briefly describes the Workstation Tool. \n\n![img](images/About.jpg)\n\n## StageNow Encryption\nThe StageNow database is always encrypted and linked to the Administrator password.\n\nEncrypting staging data for use outside of the StageNow Workstation Tool protects sensitive information.\n\n* When exporting a profile, sensitive parameters are encrypted to protect confidential deployment information.\n\n* Staging bar codes and NFC tags contain configuration data and are encrypted by default to protect against reading by unauthorized devices. Note that encryption can add a significant amount of information and require additional bar codes. Use extreme caution when turning off encryption in order to speed deployment, as sensitive parameters may be vulnerable to unauthorized access.\n\n## Use Cases\nThe staging administrator uses pre-defined Wizards within the StageNow Workstation Tool to configure settings and create profiles which define software configuration and/or installation for mobile devices within an enterprise.  These Wizards represent common use cases for deploying information to devices. \n\n### StageNow Staging Process Overview\nThe general staging process is as follows. See the appropriate sections of this guide for more detail on each step.\n\n1. The administrator determines the software configuration and/or installation required for mobile devices within the enterprise.\n\n2. The administrator opens the StageNow Workstation Tool and selects one of the provided Wizards. A Wizard offers a series of screens in which the administrator defines the required configuration values to create a profile for the device(s).\n\n3. The administrator progresses through the Wizard. Certain sections of each Wizard present setting templates. Selecting and saving values on this template creates a setting, which the administrator can save for later use when creating other profiles.\n\n4. Upon completing the Wizard, the administrator creates a profile, or a series of settings.\n\n5. The administrator reviews the profile for accuracy.\n\n6. The administrator selects the method(s) for deployment, e.g., the type of bar code and/or an NFC tag.\n\n7. The administrator verifies the functionality of the profile by generating and testing the staging material.\n\n8. The administrator publishes the profile for device deployment.\n\n9. The operator uses the Workstation Tool to select the profile published by the administrator required for device deployment.\n\n10. The operator prints the staging bar code(s) or generates the NFC tag provided for the profile.\n\n11. The operator uses the StageNow Client on the device to scan the bar code or read the NFC tag, deploying the profile information to that device.\n\n### StageNow Wizards\nStageNow offers the following Wizards for creating profiles to configure mobile devices within the enterprise:\n\n* [Configure a Device](#Profiles-configdevice) - Configure the most common device settings such as locale, security options, applications, MDM enrollment, and production network settings.

For staging, these devices scan StageNow-generated bar codes using the RD Client. This connects the client to a network, installs MX and StageNow on the device, and launches StageNow to stage/configure the device using the settings specified in the StageNow Workstation Tool. Due to the older OS, these devices only support partial StageNow functionality.\n\nSpecifically, to stage a device that includes RD Client:\n\n1. The administrator uses the StageNow Workstation Tool to generate RD or StageNow profile bar code(s).\n\n2. The operator uses the device to scan the bar code(s). This downloads and installs other device components, including MX Framework and the StageNow Client.\n\n3. The device reboots, and then StageNow Client automatically launches and completes the staging process in order to apply the profile settings. \n\n![img](images/Client_RDclient.png)\n"},{"key":"stagingprofiles","name":"Profiles","md":"#Profiles\n\n## Introduction\nThis section provides information for the staging administrator on creating and managing profiles. The StageNow Workstation Tool offers pre-defined Wizards that represent common use cases for deploying information to mobile devices within the enterprise. \n\n### Welcome Tips\nSeveral screens throughout the Workstation Tool offer helpful pop-up tips. Select the checkbox offered in order to dismiss the tip permanently. Select OK to dismiss the pop-up.\n\n![img](images/Review_withHelppopup.jpg)\n\n\n## Creating a Staging Profile\nThe staging administrator uses the provided StageNow Wizards to configure settings which define software configuration and installation for enterprise devices. When creating a profile for staging the device, the administrator progresses through the following steps in the banner provided in the Workstation Tool:\n\n![img](images/banner.jpg)\n\n* [Config](#stagingprofiles?Configure) (StageNow and RD) - The setting information entered in the StageNow Config section is stored within StageNow bar codes, NFC tags, and/or an audio file.  The setting information entered in the RD Config section is stored within RD bar codes.  Note that the RD Config section only appears if you turned on Legacy Mode in the [Settings](#gettingstarted?Settings) screen. The amount of settings created in this section affect the number of bar codes and/or NFC tags that the system generates later.\n\n* [Deployment](#stagingprofiles?Deployment) - This information includes settings that do not reside in StageNow bar codes, NFC tags, or audio file, and is represented as a file on the StageNow deployment server and so requires network connection. Reading the bar code or NFC tag, or playing an audio file created in the Config section connects the client device to the server and points to this file for deployment. Note that this section does NOT appear in the Connect Network, Manage Device Security, and Wipe a Device Wizards.\n\n* [Review](#stagingprofiles?Review) - The Review section presents all setting information entered in the Config and Deployment sections in a single page. The administrator can add comments, complete the profile, or return to any setting to update it.\n\n* [Publish](#stagingprofiles?Publish) - The Publish section allows the administrator to select the method of delivery (linear bar codes, PDF417 bar codes, NFC tags, or Audio file) for the completed profile, as well as test, publish, and stage the profile.\n\n### Profile States\nAs you progress through the Wizard, the top right corner of the window reflects the state of the profile: \n\n![img](images/profilestatus.jpg)\n\n* Incomplete - The profile is not yet complete.\n\n* Complete - All information required by the Wizard is included in the profile, but it is not yet tested to ensure the profile functions as intended.\n\n* Tested - The profile was tested to determine whether it is sufficiently operational for staging. It is not yet visible to the operator.\n\n* Published - The profile is visible to the operator.\n\n* Staged - The operator has acquired the profile, i.e., generated bar codes, exported data to write to an NFC tag, or downloaded the audio file for staging the device.\n\n### Navigating the Wizard\nFollowing are tips for navigating through the Wizard.\n\nClick on the sections of the primary banner (e.g., StageNow Config, RD Config) to view that section. Note that you must complete each section in order before you can click ahead to the next section.\n\n![img](images/banner.jpg)\n\n\nYou can also use the Back button to return to the previous section and the Continue button to proceed to the next section.\n\n![img](images/backcontinue.jpg)\n\n\nSimilarly, click on the oval buttons in the secondary banner to view that sub-section. You must also complete each sub-section before clicking ahead to the next one. \n\n![img](images/bubbles.jpg)\n\nThe small round buttons adjacent to each oval button indicate the status of that section:\n\n  *  A green check icon indicates that section is complete.\n\n  *  A green eye icon indicates the section you are viewing.\n\n  *  An orange icon with a pencil indicates the section that is in process.\n\n  *  An orange icon with a pause indicates the section that is in process while you are viewing another section.\n\n  *  A greyed-out oval with no adjacent round button indicates a section not yet started.\n\nYou can also use the arrows at the beginning and end of the secondary banner to scroll through these sub-sections. \n\n![img](images/arrow.jpg)\n\n\nWhen you select Yes for a secondary banner item, additional sub-sections are added to the banner. \n\n![img](images/subsection.jpg)\n\nTo edit the profile name, click the pencil icon next to the name.\n\n![img](images/RenameProfile.jpg)\n\nAt any point, click the Home button to return to the Home screen. \n\n![img](images/homebutton.jpg)\n\n\nWhen populating a setting template window within a Wizard, to make the setting available for selection when creating other profiles, select the Save Setting for Re-use checkbox, and enter a name for the setting. See [Save for Reuse](#settingconfig?Save%20for%20Reuse) for more information.\n\n## Configure\nTo create a profile, open the StageNow Workstation Tool and log in.\n\nSelect Create New Profile, and then select the device MX version from the drop-down menu. The tool retains the current selection when configuring future profiles.\n\nInitially, a warning appears indicating that selecting an incorrect version can cause staging to fail. If your devices run multiple versions of MX, select the lowest common version. Select the checkbox on this window if you do not need to view it in future profile creations.\n\n![img](images/WizardList_MXdropdown.jpg)\n\nSelect one of the following Wizards and select Create.\n\n* [Configure a Device](#Profiles-configdevice)\n\n* [Connect Network](#Profiles-ConnectNetwork)\n\n* [Enroll in an MDM](#Profiles-enrollmdm)\n\n* [Manage Applications](#Profiles-manageapps)\n\n* [Manage Device Security](#Profiles-managesecurity)\n\n* [Perform OS Update](#Profiles-osupdate)\n\n* [Wipe a Device](#Profiles-wipedevice)\n\n* [Xpert Mode](#Profiles-xpertmode)\n\nAfter completing the StageNow Config and RD Config sections of the Wizard, proceed to the next section of the Wizard.  Certain Wizards include a Deployment section, whereas others proceed to the Review section.\n\n### MX 6.0 Selection\n\nSelecting MX 6.0 from the MX version drop-down menu supports a Wi-Fi hotspot option for some Wizards. If you select MX 6.0 for the applicable Wizards, the first Wizard window prompts you to select one of the following options from the drop-down menu:\n\n* The devices I wish to provision are currently not connected to a network. I will define a network with this profile that will be used for staging.\n\n* The devices I wish to provision are already connected to a network that will be used for staging. \n\n* I wish to use the WiFi Hotspot feature which will automatically create a network for staging using this computer's network card. \n\n![img](images/profiles/configdevice_wifi.jpg)\n\nSelect an option and proceed to the instructions for the selected Wizard.\n\n>Note:  \n>The second and third options are only supported by Wizards that utilize the Deployment section of the tool.\n\n## Deployment\nUse the Deployment section of the Wizard to specify the subset of the settings that define what the profile does, and store these settings on a deployment server. See the specific [Profile Wizard](#ProfileWizards) for instructions. \nNote that this section is not available in certain Wizards. \n\nWizards that include the Deployment section require that device(s) access the Deployment Server in order to acquire the information provided there. Specifically, the device and the server should be on the same network, or there should be routing from the device network that allows connection to the Deployment Server. \n\n![img](images/createprofile_deploy1.jpg)\n\n## Review\nThe Review section of the Wizard allows you to verify your selections.\n\n![img](images/OSUpdate_Review.jpg)\n\n1. Select Expand to view the StageNow configuration and RD configuration settings. This setting list offers the following fields:\n    * Step - The section step where the Administrator added the setting.\n    * Description - A user-defined \"friendly\" description of the setting.\n    * Last Updated - Last time the profile was updated.\n    * View - Click to view/modify the setting.\n\n2.

This entails configuring, deploying, and managing systems and devices.\n\nStaging can be performed at a centralized location, where all devices in an enterprise are configured and deployed together, in a particular store or site, where all devices at that site are configured and deployed, or on-site/per user, where a single device is configured for that site or user.\n\n## Stage Now Staging Solution\nStageNow is ZebraΓÇÖs next generation Android staging solution, supporting KitKat and Jelly Bean and built on the MX 4.3 platform. It allows simple profile creation, and easy device deployment with a simple bar code scan or tag read.\n\nThe StageNow solution includes the following components:\n* The Staging Tool offers a user interface that is accessed within a staging workstation (host computer). The staging administrator uses this tool to create staging profiles by configuring device components, in addition to other staging actions.\nThe Staging Tool includes the Staging Database and Staging Server which store content entered in the Staging Tool, e.g., setting templates and staging profiles. Staging data is persistent.\n* The Staging Client resides on the device and provides a user interface for the staging operator to initiate staging. The operator uses a staging modality, e.g., prints and scans a bar code, to deliver staging material to the device\n\n### Devices Supported\nStageNow supports All KitKat and Jelly Bean Android Devices:\n\n* TC70 (Android KitKat 4.4.2)\n\n* TC55 (non GMS) (Android Jelly Bean 4.1.2) \n\n* MC40 (Android Jelly Bean 4.1.1)\n\n### StageNow Users\nFollowing are the StageNow users:\n* The staging administrator is the main user of the Staging Tool, and is responsible for the configuration, deployment, and management of systems and client devices. The administrator creates profiles which identify the staging to perform, collects the staging content (e.g., applications), and uploads this content into the Staging Tool.\n* The staging operator identifies the devices to stage and uses the Staging Tool to view and select the profiles that the administrator published. The operator then determines the staging materials to use to stage the devices (e.g., bar codes), performs the staging, and delivers the devices to the end users\n\n### Staging Methods/Modalities\nFollowing are the staging methods available via StageNow. See Device Staging on page 4-1 for details:\n* Bar Code Profile - The operator prints the bar code(s) containing profile information and scans with the device to configure that device.\n* NFC Tag - The operator exports profile data to an NFC tag, then reads the tag with the device within a certain proximity to deploy the profile to the device.\n\n"}];
